### 0.5.0 / 2012-12-12

Thanks to the many who have submitted pull requests. A bunch of them are in
this release. Special thanks to Nick Muerdter, who succeeded in porting the
adapter to work with the JDBC Postgres adapter in JRuby, and also got Travis
up and running for the project.

* Add JRuby compatibility with the activerecord-jdbcpostgresql-adapter gem.
  (Pull request by Nick Muerdter)
* Allow WKT to be to be specified as a string-like object rather than having
  to be a String. (Pull request by Bryan Larsen)

  db:schema:dump. (Pull request by Greg Phillips)
* Create schemas specified in schema_search_path only if they don't exist.
  (Pull request by legendetm)
* Force the postgis_topology extension be created in the topology schema.
  (Pull request by Dimitri Roche)
* Specifically set the ownership of the postgis related tables to the
  regular user. (Pull request by corneverbruggen)
* The gemspec no longer includes the timestamp in the version, so that
  bundler can pull from github. (Reported by corneverbruggen)
* Update tests for PostGIS 2.0 compatibility.
* Travis-CI integration. (Pull request by Nick Muerdter)
* Add a missing srid in the Readme. (Pull request by gouthamvel)
* Readme clarifies that BoundingBox objects can be used in a query only for
  projected coordinate systems. (Reported by Tee Parham)
* Update URLs to point to new website.


### 0.4.3 / 2012-04-13

* Rake tasks failed on Rails 3.0.x because of an issue with
  rgeo-activerecord pre-0.4.5. Now we require the fixed version.


### 0.4.2 / 2012-04-12

* Support the db:structure:load rake task in recent versions of Rails.
* Support installing PostGIS via the PostgreSQL extension mechanism
  (requires at least PostGIS 2.0 and PostgreSQL 9.1).
* Support bounding boxes in queries (useful for "window" queries such as
  finding objects to display in a map region).
* Fix some issues determine the correct default value for spatial columns.


### 0.4.1 / 2012-02-22

* Some compatibility fixes for Rails 3.2. (Reported by Ryan Williams with
  implementation help from Radek Paviensky.)
* Now requires rgeo-activerecord 0.4.3.


### 0.4.0 / 2011-08-15

* Various fixes for Rails 3.1 compatibility.
* Now requires rgeo-activerecord 0.4.0.
* INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: simple queries (e.g. MyClass.where(:latlon =>
  my_point)) use an objective rather than spatial equality test. Earlier
  versions transformed this form to use st_equals, but now if you need to
  test for spatial equality, you'll need to call st_equals explicitly. I'm
  still evaluating which direction we want to go with this in the future,
  but we may be stuck with the current behavior because the hack required to
  transform these queries to use spatial equality was egregious and broke in
  Rails 3.1 with no clear workaround.


### 0.3.6 / 2011-06-21

* Require latest rgeo-activerecord to get some fixes.
* Note PostgreSQL 9 requirement in the README. (Reported by Samuel Cochran)
* Now doesn't throw exceptions if an RGeo cast fails when setting an
  attribute.


### 0.3.5 / 2011-04-12

* The .gemspec was missing the databases.rake file. Fixed.


### 0.3.4 / 2011-04-11

* A .gemspec file is now available for gem building and bundler git
  integration.


### 0.3.3 / 2011-02-28

* INCOMPATIBLE CHANGE: the default SRID for non-geography columns is now -1,
  rather than 4326. (Geography columns still default to 4326.)
* It is now possible to create a spatial column without a corresponding
  entry in the geometry_columns table, and the adapter now handles this case
  properly. (Reported by Pirmin Kalberer)
* Now requires rgeo-activerecord 0.3.1 (which brings a critical fix
  involving declaring multiple spatial columns in a migration).


### 0.3.2 / 2011-02-11

* You can now specify a separate "database creation" superuser role so your
  normal PostgreSQL login role doesn't need superuser privileges when
  running database creation tasks.
* Database creation tasks automatically create all schemas listed in the
  schema search path.


### 0.3.1 / 2011-02-01

* Fixed a syntax error that prevented the adapter from loading on Ruby 1.8.
  Whoops. (Reported by miguelperez)


### 0.3.0 / 2011-01-26

* Reworked type and constraint handling, which should result in a large
  number of bug fixes, especially related to schema dumps.
* Experimental support for complex spatial queries. (Requires Arel 2.1,
  which is expected to be released with Rails 3.1.)
* The path to the Railtie is now different (see the README), though a
  compatibility wrapper has been left in the old location.
* Getting index information from the ActiveRecord class now properly
  recognizes spatial-ness.
* Reorganized the code a bit for better clarity.


### 0.2.3 / 2011-01-06

* Many of ActiveRecord's rake tasks weren't working because they need to
  know about every adapter explicitly. I hesitate to call this "fixed" since
  I see it as a problem in ActiveRecord, but we now at least have a
  workaround so the rake tasks will run properly. (Reported by Tad Thorley.)
* Dumping schema.rb now omits the PostGIS internal tables.
* Added a new configuration parameter pointing to the script directory, for
  rake db:create.
* If the "postgis" schema is included in the schema search path, it is used
  as a container for the PostGIS internal definitions when running rake
  db:create. Furthermore, that schema is omitted when dumping the
  structure.sql. This should eliminate all the PostGIS internal cruft from
  SQL structure dumps, and also eliminate the errors that would appear when
  rebuilding a test database because the PostGIS internals would get applied
  twice.


### 0.2.2 / 2010-12-27

* Support for basic spatial equality queries. e.g. constructs such as:
    MyClass.where(:geom_column => factory.point(1, 2))
    MyClass.where(:geom_column => 'POINT(1 2)')

* Fixed an exception when adding spatial columns where the column name is
  specified as a symbol.


### 0.2.1 / 2010-12-15

* Provides meta-information to RGeo 0.2.2 or later to support access to
  PostGIS's spatial reference system table.


### 0.2.0 / 2010-12-07

* Initial public alpha release. Spun activerecord-postgis-adapter off from
  the core rgeo gem.
* You can now set the factory for a specific column by name.
